    <p>Ever since my childhood, I'm just a regular kid living my life to its fullest while young. Then fast forward to my teenage years, I've been a lot different.
        I tried exploring a lot of things such as playing instruments and playing my most favorite sport, the basketball. I find immense joy and fulfillment in pursuing these activities. 
        My time as a Senior High student gave way to me loving the computer. After getting my personal computer, 
        I immediately fell in love to its technology which brings us to my present self studying how computers works.</p>
    <p>Outside of academics, you can see me:</p>

        <li>Play mobile and computer video games.</li>
        <li>Play guitar.</li>
        <li>Watch a variety of Anime shows.</li>
        <li>Read books specifically Japanese mangas.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My pleasant, social personality enjoys interacting with people and doing new things. I have a reputation for being positive and hopeful, and I take a flexible and exploratory attitude to life. 
        I'm naturally interested in learning new things and seeing the world from different angles. I find joy in every moment and cherish the connections I make along the way. 
        Which is why I can confidently say that the relationships I established throughout my life have been excellent.</p>
